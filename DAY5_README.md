# Day 5: Advanced Detection and Multi-Modal Analysis

This document provides instructions for running and testing the Day 5 implementation of the Deepfake Detector project, which focuses on advanced detection techniques, multi-modal analysis, enhanced user interface, and performance optimizations.

## Features Implemented

1. **Advanced Detection Techniques**
   - Multi-model ensemble detection
   - Temporal analysis for video deepfakes
   - Specialized Indian face detection enhancements
   - Adversarial example detection

2. **Multi-Modal Analysis**
   - Combined image and audio analysis
   - Cross-modal verification
   - Contextual analysis of metadata
   - Confidence scoring across modalities

3. **Enhanced User Interface**
   - Advanced result visualization
   - Interactive analysis tools
   - Customizable detection settings
   - Batch processing capabilities

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Model quantization for faster inference
   - Parallel processing of detection tasks
   - Caching of intermediate results
   - Progressive loading of large media files

## Project Structure

- `advanced_detection.py` - Advanced detection techniques implementation
- `multimodal_analyzer.py` - Multi-modal analysis implementation
- `enhanced_api.py` - Enhanced API with new endpoints
- `src/pages/AdvancedDashboard.tsx` - Advanced dashboard component
- `src/pages/MultimodalAnalysis.tsx` - Multi-modal analysis component
- `run_day5.bat` - Script to run the Day 5 implementation

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- Required Python packages: `flask`, `flask-cors`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `fpdf`, `tensorflow`, `torch`, `librosa`, `scikit-learn`
- Required npm packages (install with `npm install`)

### Option 1: Using the Run Script

1. Run the Day 5 script:
   ```
   .\run_day5.bat
   ```

2. Access the application at http://localhost:8080

### Option 2: Manual Startup

1. Start the API server:
   ```
   python enhanced_api.py
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the frontend:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Access the application at http://localhost:8080

## New API Endpoints

Day 5 introduces several new API endpoints:

- `/api/advanced-detect` - Advanced detection with multiple models
- `/api/multimodal-analyze` - Multi-modal analysis of media
- `/api/batch-process` - Batch processing of multiple files
- `/api/detection-settings` - Get/update detection settings
- `/api/model-performance` - Get model performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Performance Issues**
   - Try using the optimized models with `?optimized=true` parameter
   - Reduce batch size for large files
   - Check system resource usage during processing

2. **Multi-Modal Analysis Issues**
   - Ensure both audio and video components are available
   - Check format compatibility for audio analysis
   - Verify temporal alignment settings

3. **API Server Issues**
   - Check for error messages in the terminal
   - Verify all required packages are installed
   - Check model availability in the models directory

## Testing

Run the test script to verify everything is working:
```
python test_day5.py
```

This will:
- Test all new API endpoints
- Verify multi-modal analysis functionality
- Check performance optimizations
- Test the enhanced user interface

## Next Steps

After successfully implementing Day 5, future enhancements could include:
- Cloud-based distributed processing
- Real-time streaming analysis
- Integration with external verification services
- Mobile application development# Day 5: Advanced Detection and Multi-Modal Analysis
